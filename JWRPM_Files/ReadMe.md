## Supporting code for manuscript (currently under review at Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management

## Description
This repository is intended to hold code, documentation, and tutorials for the USGS Consumptive Use Project run through Dr. Julie Shortridge and Dr. Durelle Scott of Virginia Tech as well as Robert Burgholzer and Joseph Kleiner of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.

## Objectives
This project has two objectives. The first is to develop a set of data retrieval and export tools to supply updated NPDES DMR data to the VAHydro data system, and to then export withdrawl, discharge, and consumptive use data from VAHydro in a machine-readable format consistent with NWIS requirements. The second objective is to leverage this DMR data to estimate consumptive use across different user categories, assess trends in consumptive use through time, and develop statistical methods for estimating non-reported consumptive use.
